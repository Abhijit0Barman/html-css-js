The <link> elements in the <head> element are used to link external stylesheets to the document.
The <title> element specifies the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
The <body> element contains the visible content of the document, such as text, images, and forms.
The <header> element contains the header section of the document, which typically includes the logo and navigation menu.
The <nav> element contains the navigation menu of the document.
The <ul> element is used to create an unordered list, and the <li> element is used to define a list item.
The <a> element is used to create a hyperlink, and the href attribute specifies the URL of the link.
The <img> element is used to embed an image in the document.
The <section> element is used to define a section of the document, and the id attribute is used to give the section a unique identifier.
The <h1> to <h6> elements are used to define headings, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> being the lowest level.
The <p> element is used to define a paragraph of text.
The <button> element is used to create a clickable button.
